Moodle 2.7+ filter which converts text between [%   %] to easychem chemical
structures and formulas.  It utilizes easychem.js which was written
by Peter Win - (www.easychem.org ).

Note: This filter was designed to be used with the Easychem
Atto Editor (moodle-atto_easychem).  You should install it after
this for best results.

1) Download the zip file from my git hub site.

3) Proceed to the notifications section of the admin panel.
